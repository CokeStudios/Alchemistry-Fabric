# Alchemistry - Fabric Mod
_This is a Fabric port of the original Alchemistry mod by Dark_Arcana. It allows you to break down any item in the world into chemical components, which you can recombine into other items. Inspired by the MineChem mod, Alchemistry brings real life chemistry to Minecraft, with hundreds of chemical compounds to experiment with!_
